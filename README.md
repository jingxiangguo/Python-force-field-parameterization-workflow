# A data-driven approach to systematically and reproduciably optimize force-field parameters 

<img src="workflow.png" width="800">

## Features:
* Efficient adoption of parallism to perform sampling with a parallel simulator
* Diverse choices of force-field functional forms supported by the chosen simulator
* Flexible inclusions of distinct physical properties as reference data
* Modular design to facilitate the exstensions with user-defined:
    - objective functional forms
    - sampling methods/force-field potential functional forms
    - optimization algorithms

## Softwares required:

* A compiled MD/MC packages exectuable (LAMMPS is already supported)

* Slurm Workload Manager (or equivalent) 

* Python 3.7

* Other Python libraries: pytest==5.4.2, numpy==1.18.1

* Intel Fortran compiler (> version 18.0.3).
  gfortran (4.8.5) also compiles successfully,
  but the program may not work with a long absolute file path.

## Installation on Linux:

conda is the recommended package manager. If 'conda' is not not found or root previliage is required,
you can download anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual to your home directory.
Then, install the package: https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/  

* create a conda environment with specific version of numpy and python:  

```
conda create -n "env name" python=3.7 numpy=1.18.1 
```

* copy this GitHub repo to your local directory:

```
git clone https://github.com/jingxiangguo/Python-force-field-parameterization-workflow.git 
```

```
cd Python-force-field-parameterization-workflow
``` 
* install the package to your conda environment 

```
pip install -e .
```
* A Fortran library "fortranAPI" come with the package.
Inside Fortran routines are C-interoperable, and thus can be
callable through Python using ctypes modules.

* Note that this Fortran library is independent. 
It provides some trajectory readers 
and radial distribution function calculations routines.

* To compile it, run GNU "make" command. 

``` 
make
``` 
* Test your installation.

``` 
optimize -h
``` 
```
usage: optimize [-h] -c CORES -i INPUT -j JOB [-m MODE] [-Ref REFERENCEDATA]
                [-prep PREPSYSTEM]

This is a Python software package implementing a force-field parameters
optimization workflow

```

* Run some unit-testings to further check the installation 
(You may need to install pytest) 

```
conda install pytest
```

```
pytest optimizer/

pytest fortranAPI/

```
